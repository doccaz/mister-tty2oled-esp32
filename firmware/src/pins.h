// fixed native-USB pins (GPIO18/19, used automatically by Serial and never
// wired here), the in-package flash pins on FN4/FH4 modules (GPIO11-17),
// and GPIO5/6, which this board's onboard 0.42" SSD1306 OLED (72x40,
// driven as a 128x64 panel) uses as fixed I2C SDA/SCL - not
// user-selectable, since it's built into the board rather than wired by
// hand. GPIO20/21 are deliberately left unclaimed for the Serial0 debug
// UART (see protocol.cpp's DBG_ENABLED).
